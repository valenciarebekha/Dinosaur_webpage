                <p>Fossils are remains of animals, plants, humans, and anceint life that are preserved in rock layers or
                    sediment. Such as plants, skin, feathers and hair, most commonly found are bones, teeth, claws, and
                    shells.

            </heading>
            <p>
                Fossils are found anywhere that has layered rocks of the right age and type. Fossils are usually found
                in
                sedimentary rock which forms when sand, salt, silt, mud, or the calcium carbonate shells of sea
                creatures
                settle in those layers. These layers of different rocks are called strata. Finding the right strata
                requires
                a paleontologists to walk around and search for clues; fossils may be on the surface exposed or the rock
                may
                show
                signs of fossils underneath them, this is called prospecting. What kind of fossils are in the area
                depend on
                the location, type, and age of the rock. Once a fossil is found paleontologist dig around the fossil
                using
                tools like paintbrushes,
                awls, rock hammers, chissels, and other tools to uncover the fossil. When done escavating they cover the
                fossil in plastrue to protect it from damage when transporting it.

            <p>Palentologist can discover various things from researching fossils from age, diseases, diet, enviorment,
                and
                injurys. There are different type of subdisciplines of palentology who unraveil these discoverys.</p>
