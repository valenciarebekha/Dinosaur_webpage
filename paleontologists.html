            <p>Barnum Brown, commonly referred to as Mr.Bones, discovered the first documented remains of <il>

                    rex
                </il> and six years later he found a even more completed skeleton (including a preserved skull) which
                made
                hom
                one of the most famous fossil hunters. He would travel the world in search of fossils, from Indaia to

                and the <il>Trciceratops</il> and theories on the orgins of birds. In his career he competed in "The

                Wars"
                with his Edward Drinker Cope
                another renound paletologist; both palentologists made finds of valueable scientific research
                but while Cope discovered a total of 56 new dinosaur species, Marsh discovered 80; in total discovering
                156
                new
                dinosaur species.</p>
