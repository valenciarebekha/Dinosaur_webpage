            <p>Museums have many purposes other than displaying cool fossils, skeletons, and artifacts to the
                public. Some are
                research
                facilities, archivists, conservationists, and libraries. Museums are actively conserving artifacts
                and
                specimens

            </header>

            <p> The Field Museum is known for its scientific research, conservation, labs, and most importantly its
                mission to connect people to the natural world and the human story through science and education by
                making
                it accessible to everyone. Their prehistoric history covers from early life, The age of fishes, the
                Permian
                period, to the Triassic period, Jurassic period, Cretaceous period, and at last the Cenozoic era.
                Now I will
                be
                covering the legendary dinosaur of The Field Museum that gets estimated 1.4 million visits a year.
                Sue
                the
                <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> was discovered in August 12, 1990 while exploring the Cheyenne River Sioux
                Reservation
                in
                South Dakota by fossil hunter Sue Hendrickson who they named the
                <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> after, and was excavated by a team from the Black Hills Institute of
                Geological
                Research.
                Sue impressive length stretches up to 40 feet long and standing at the hip 13 feet.
                Sue is the most complete and best preserved <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> ever found, 90% of her skeleton
                is
                completed.
                The
                Field Museum
                acquired Sue by bidding at a highly publicized contested auction in 1999 with the support from
                corporate
                sponsors like McDonalds and Disney and
                individual donors. A bid record of $8.36 million Sue was brought to The Field Museum. The great bid
                won
                more than a valuable fossil but a great scientific and public education resource. Sue arrived at The
                Field Museum in 1998, scientists spent two years cleaning, stabilizing, mounting, and studying the
                bones.
                Sue
                served as
                a resource for understanding the biology and behavior of <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>, it has provided
                insights into dinosaur
                growth health, and predatory lifestyle. In 2000, Sue
                was unveiled in the museums Stanley Field Hall becoming the museum's star attraction. Sue's real
                skull is
                so
                heavy that it's displayed separately in a nearby gallery, while a lightweight replica sits on the
                mounted
                skeleton.

                The museum houses more than 30 million zoological, paleontological, and mineralogical specimens,
                including
                more than ten thousand types of specimens. It is famous for two exhibits the largest mounted
                dinosaur
                in
                the
                world and a well-preserved specimen of the earliest known bird, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. The
                <i>Giraffatitan brancai</i>
                (formerly <i>Brachiosaurs</i>) in the central exhibit hall is the largest mounted dinosaur skeleton
                in
                the
                world.
                It was found by paleontologist Werner Janensch from Tendaguru beds of Tanzania between 1909 and
                1913.
                The
                team excavated more than 225 tons of fossil material, including the nearly complete <i>Giraffatitan
                    brancai</i>
                skeleton.
                <i>Giraffatitan brancai</i> was 41 feet and 5 inches tall and 73 feet long. In 2007 it was remounted
                due
                to new
                scientific research regarding modern scientific research understanding of <i>Sauropod</i> anotomy,
                now
                reaching 13.27 meters due to its long tail and neck.
            </p>

            <p>The <i>Archaeopteryx</i> the "first bird" is displayed in the central of exhibit. It is described as
                having a
                dinosaur figure with
                feathered wings, claws, and a long lizard tail. Recovered from the German solnhofen limestone beds
                in
                1871,
                it is one of the 12 <i>Archaeopteryx</i> to be discovered and the most complete. It's feathered
                wings
                were so
                well
                preserved that scientists can study their structure under microscopes to learn how feathers evolved.

                The museum has 21 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, including a
                planetarium
                and a library. The museum collections contain 13 million specimens of plants, animals, fungi,
                fossils,
                minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts. As well as a specialized
                collections for frozen tissue and genomic and astrophysical data (only a small fraction can be
                displayed at any given time). The museum sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year and
                averages about five million visits annually. The Theodore Roosevelt Hall is home to Theodore
                Roosevelt's
                memorial and known for the iconic dinosaur exhibit.
                The <i>Barosaurus</i> and <i>Allosaurus</i> display show a mother rearing up to defend her baby
                from an attacking
                <i>Allosaurus</i>. While the display is made of lightweight replicas since the real bones are too
                heavy to be mounted this way. The real fossil bones originally excavated from the Morrison Formation
                in Utah are preserved behind the scenes in the museum's
                paleontology collections safely stored in a climate controlled room to prevent damage from humidity,
                light, vibration or handling.

            <p>The Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology is Canada's only museum dedicated exclusively to the study of
                ancient life. Featuring one of the world's largest displays of dinosaurs. The museum displays
                sabertooth
                tigers attacking a mammoth as well as a living garden that recreates life
                during the Cretaceous period in Alberta. Visitors can watch paleontologists at work in the
                preparation
                lab
                to see how they prepare fossilized bones. More than 13,000 fossils are located in this
                paleontological
                research center home, including the "Black Beauty"<i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> skeleton with its unique
                dark
                sheen.
                The
                <i>Borealopelta</i> dinosaur was discovered on March 21, 2011, at the Millennium mine, it was
                discovered
                by a
                miner
                Shawn Funk, who was digging in the bank and noticed the specimen by striking it. The operators
                alerted
                the
                Royal Tyrell Museum of paleontology. After three days of safety training, museum staff and Suncor
                began
                working to recover the pieces. It preserved not only the armor in their life positions but also
                remains
                of
                their keratin sheaths, overlaying skin, and stomach contents from its last meal

                in
                Sichuan Province of China. The fossil site belonged to the Upper Shaximiao Formation dating the late
